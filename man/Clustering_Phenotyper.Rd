\description{
\code{Clustering_Phenotyper()} assigns cell phenotypes based on clustering. Phenotype names can be then modidified using \code{\link[=DATA_Phenotype_renamer]{DATA_Phenotype_renamer()}}
}
\details{
De-noising process does not remove cells from the final output. It rather assigns noise cells to a single phenotype. Otsu thresholding and DBSCAN based denoising are based on EBImage::otsu and dbscan::dbscan functions, respectively.

Dimension reduction can be performed using PCA (svd::propack.svd function), t-SNE (snifter::fitsne function) and UMAP (uwot::tumap function). For t-SNE and UMAP a model can be build using a subset of data and then predicting coordinates for all the cells. This can be more computationally efficient.
The first time TSNE is sused, snifter will install a CONDA distribution in you R library through basilisk package. The path to the library is relevant. Any non-standard characters in you path may lead to errors (non ASCII characters, spaces...).

Consensus clustering is performed using the ConsensusClusterPlus::ConsensusClusterPlus function.

Self Organizing Maps clustering is performed using the FlowSOM::FlowSOM function.

For graph based clustering Nearest neighbors graphs are built using bluster::makeSNNGraph and clustered using functions included in the igraph package.

K_Means_Meta_clustering first summarizes cell feature matrix observations using K means algorithm and the performs Consensus Clustering. Afterwards results are generalized to all cells.

Batch K-means, Gaussian Mixture Models and Clustering Large Applications are all based on the ClusterR package.
