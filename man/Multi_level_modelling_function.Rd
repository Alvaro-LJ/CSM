\value{
A list containing two outputs: Raw_DATA contains the expected interaction probability for every distance point. Simplified_DATA cotains the AUC data by image.

\description{
The function calculates a multilevel model to analyze the spatial interaction between two cell types. The spatial cumulative interaction between two cell types,
one being the Cell of Origin (COO) and the other being the target cell, is dependent on two main variables: the target cell density and distance from the cell of origin.
If the tissue target cell density is higher, or the distance from the COO is larger, the spatial interaction is going to increase.
The function tries to model the influence of image metadata on this spatial interaction. It does so by considering cells in the dataset as nested observations,
where cells within the same image share specific characteristics (like exposure to the same target cell density or image metadata condition).
The model formula will look something like this: N umber of Target cells ~ Image_Metadata*Distance_COO + Density_Target + (1|Cell_Of_Origin_ID)
The multilevel model is calculated using lme4::lmer function. The contribution of each variables to the total variance explanation is calculated using the partR2::partR2 function.
